# CS480
This repository contains the projects that I worked on solo and as part of a group in the computer science class CS 480 - Graphics, a class at the University of Nevada, Reno.
This class is about graphics programming, with focus on the OpenGL pipeline. The projects were developed using C++ for Linux.
As the class advanced, we started using the [Bullet physics SDK](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) to add interactivity to our projects.
